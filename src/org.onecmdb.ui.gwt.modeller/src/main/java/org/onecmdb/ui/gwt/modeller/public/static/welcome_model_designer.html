<h2 align="left" class="style1">The Model Designer application</h2>
<p align="left" class="style1">The Model Designer Application gives you a possibility to view and edit the OneCMDB model. This can also be done in the OneCMDB Admin GUI, which also existed in previous OneCMDB versions. The Admin GUI works in a way that reminds of a file explorer. Each instance, reference and template in the CMDB can be viewed and edited, down to the smallest detail. It is however not that easy to view how the model is built up, and how things relate to each other, this may be easier in this Model Designer.</p>
<p align="left" class="style1">The Model Designer Application presents templates in a tree hierachy and instances in tables with all attributes lined up to provide a good overview. It is easy to create new templates and understand how templates inherit characteristics from each other. It is also swift to create new instances from the templates. It has however some limitations and in some cases it is better to use the Admin GUI. </p>

 * An attribute is said to keep a <em>value</em>, which itself is
 * polymorphic:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <em>primitive</em> which maps to the basic types from XML Schema.
 * <li>Another, already existing, configuration item.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>When the attribute's value is asked for, the retrieval is either a 
 * configuration item, making the attribute merely a pointer. By changing the
 * value, another configuration item is pointed at.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An attribute may have nested attributes, because an attribute <em>is a</em>
 * configuration item, making it possible to make use of attributes in a way
 * familiar with C structs.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that this interface describes the <em>Read Only</em> side of the
 * attribute. If an attribute is to be modified use the 
 * {@link IAttributeModifable} interface instead.</p>

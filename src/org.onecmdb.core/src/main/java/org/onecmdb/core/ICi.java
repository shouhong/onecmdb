 * <p>The basic module, ICiServie, knows about all CIs ever defined. Defining

 * <em>identified as</em> 'ROOT'.</p>

 * <p>The IModelService makes use of the universally defined 'MODEL' CI, which
 *  is an offspring off 'ROOT'. The 'MODEL' is given the notion of an container
 * which gives it the possibility to attach, other objects, i.e. not create
 * offsprings, into the model. These other objects are offsprings from other,
 * known, <em>hives</em>, fetched via other the model service itself, or
 * other attached services.</p>

/**
 * <p>The <em>Change Control Board</em> (CCB) is responsible, and take actions,
 * for change requests (RFCs) within OneCMDB. Modifications are supposed to be 
 * handled asynchronously leaving it up to the CCB implementation to perform the
 * changes in the background. For example, a change can involve a acknowledge 
 * from a third party that is not available at the time of the change 
 * request.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Changes are grouped together in <em>transactions</em>, where <em>ALL</em>
 * changes are committed or rejected. All changes is done from new objects so 
 * in-memory objects will not be affected by committed changes. This requires
 * clients to not keep caches of memory objects.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * 
 * <p>Create a new offspring from a CI as base:</p>
 * <pre>	
 * ISession session = ...
 * ICi ci = ...
 * ICcb ccb = (ICcb)ISession.getService(ICcb.class);
 * ICmdbTransaction tx = ccb.getTx(session);
 * ICiModifiable mod =  tx.getModifiableCi(ci);
 * mod.createOffspring();
 * ITicket ticket = ccb.submitTx(tx);
 * IRfcResult result = ccb.waitForTicket(ticket);
 * if (result.isRejetced() {
 * String cause = result.getRejectedCause();
 * return(-1);
 * }

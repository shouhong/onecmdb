A patch for storing a readonly hsqldb database in a Jar was contributed by Brendan Ryan
and has been incorporated into the code base. Additional work on connection URL
allow more uniform access to this feature.

The steps required are as follows:

Ensure the database does not contain CACHED or TEXT tables.
Make the database radonly after a SHUTDOWN.
Include the two database files *.properties and *.script in a directory in your Jar
Access the database with the jdbc:hsqldb:res: protocol

The relative location of the database as taken from the jdbc url is used.
For example, if the url is specified as "jdbc:hsqldb:res:/testdata/felder"
then the database is loaded from the "/testdata/" directory in the jar
and the database file names are "felder.properties" and
felder.script" in that directory.

Brendan Ryan wrote (text and sample changed):

I have made a small change to allow a readonly hsqldb database (.script and
.properties) to be stored in a JAR file so that it can be used with JWS.

A sample jnlp file is given below.

I hope the code is useful for someone.

Brendan Ryan

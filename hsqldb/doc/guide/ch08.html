            This document explains how to use SqlTool, the main purpose of
            which is to read your SQL text file or stdin, and execute the SQL 
            commands therein against a JDBC database.
            There are also a great number of features to facilitate both
            interactive use (such as command-line editing and PL aliases)
            and automation (such as scripting variables and SQL transaction 
            control and error handling).
        </p><p>
            Some of the examples below use quoting which works exactly
            as-is for any Bourne-compatible UNIX shell.
            (Only line-continuation would need to be changed for C-compatible
            UNIX shells).
            I have not yet tested these commands on Windows, and I doubt
            whether the quoting will work just like this (though it is
            possible).
            SqlTool is still a very useful tool even if you have no quoting
            capability at all.
        </p><p>
            If you are using SqlTool from a HSQDLB distribution before
            version 1.8.0.0 final, you should use the documentation with that
            distribution
            (because, for brevity, I do not here indicate changes made to
            behavior before 1.8.0.0 final).
            This document is now updated for the current versions of SqlTool
            and SqlFile at the time I am writing this (versions 1.50 and
            1.130 correspondingly, SqlFile is the class which does most of the
            work for SqlTool).
            Therefore, if you are using a version of SqlTool or SqlFile that
            is more than a couple revisions greater, you should find a newer
            version of this document.
            (The imprecision is due to content-independent revision increments
            at build time, and the likelihood of one or two 
            behavior-independent bug fixes after public releases).
            The startup banner will report both versions when you run SqlTool
            interactively.

            If you are using an Oracle database server, it will commit your
            current transaction if you cleanly disconnect, regardless of
            whether you have set auto-commit or not.
            This will occur if you exit SqlTool (or any other client) in
            the normal way (as opposed to killing the process or using
            Ctrl-C, etc.).
            This is mentioned in this section only for brevity, so I don't
            need to mention it in the main text in the many places where
            auto-commit is discussed.
            This behavior has nothing to do with SqlTool.
            It is a quirk of Oracle.
        </p></div><p>
            If you want to use SqlTool, then you either have an SQL text file, 
            or you want to interactively type in SQL commands.
            If neither case applies to you, then you are looking at the wrong 
            program.

                    Find out where your hsqldb.jar file resides.
                    It typically resides at
<span class="bold"><b>HSQLDB_HOME</b></span><tt class="filename">/lib/hsqldb.jar</tt>
                    where <span class="bold"><b>HSQLDB_HOME</b></span> is the
                    base directory of your HSQLDB software installation.
                    For this reason, I'm going to use 
                    "$HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar" as the path to
                    <tt class="filename">hsqldb.jar</tt> for my examples, but 
                    understand that you need to use the actual path to your
                    own <tt class="filename">hsqldb.jar</tt> file.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    Run 
                <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar --help</pre></div>
                    to see what command-line arguments are available.
                    Note that you don't need to worry about setting the 
                    CLASSPATH when you use the <tt class="literal">-jar</tt> switch
                    to <tt class="filename">java</tt>.
                    Assuming that you set up your SqlTool RC file 
                    at the default location and you want to use the HSQLDB 
                    JDBC driver, you will want to run something like
                <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar mem</pre></div>
                    for interactive use, or
                <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar --sql 'SQL statement' mem</pre></div>
                    or
                    <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar mem filepath1.sql...</pre></div>
                    where <tt class="literal">mem</tt> is an
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>urlid</em></span>,
                    and the following arguments are paths to text SQL files.
                    For the filepaths, you can use whatever wildcards your 
                    operating system shell supports.
                    </p><p>
                    The <span class="emphasis"><em>urlid</em></span> <tt class="literal">mem
                    </tt>in these commands is a key 
                    into your RC file, as explained in the 
                    <a href="ch08.html#auth-section" title="RC File Authentication Setup">RC File Authentication Setup</a> section.
                    Since this is a Memory Only database, you can use SqlTool
                    with this urlid immediately with no database setup 
                    whatsoever (however, you can't persist any changes that 
                    you make to this database).
                    The sample sqltool.rc file also defines the urlid
                    "localhost-sa" for a local HSQLDB Server.
                    At the end of this section, I explain how you can load
                    some sample data to play with, if you want to.
                </p></li></ol></div><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>
            SqlTool does not <span class="emphasis"><em>commit</em></span> DML changes by default.
            This leaves it to the user's disgression whether to commit or
            rollback their modifications.
            Remember to either run the command <tt class="literal">commit;</tt>
            before quitting SqlTool, or use the <tt class="literal">--autoCommit</tt>
            command-line switch.
        </p></div><p>
            If you put a file named <tt class="filename">auto.sql</tt> into your
            home directory, this file will be executed automatically every
            time that you run SqlTool interactively and without the
            <tt class="literal">--noAutoFile</tt> switch.
        </p><p>
            To use a JDBC Driver other than the HSQLDB driver, you can't use
            the <tt class="literal">-jar</tt> switch because you need to modify the
            classpath.
            You must add the hsqldb.jar file and your JDBC driver classes to
            your classpath,
            and you must tell SqlTool what the JDBC driver class name is.
            The latter can be accomplished by either using the "--driver" 
            switch, or setting "driver" in your config file.
            The <a href="ch08.html#auth-section" title="RC File Authentication Setup">RC File Authentication Setup</a> section.
            explains the second method.  Here's an example of the first method
            (after you have set the classpath appropriately).
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
java org.hsqldb.util.SqlTool --driver oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver urlid</pre></div></p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
            If the tables of query output on your screen are all messy 
            because of lines wrapping, the best and easiest solution
            is usually to resize your terminal emulator window to make it
            wider.
            (With some terms you click &amp; drag the frame edges to resize,
            with others you use a menu system where you can enter the number
            of columns).
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N112DD"></a>Non-displayable Types</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            There are many SQL types which SqlTool (being a text-based
            program) can't display properly.
            This includes the SQL types <tt class="literal">BLOB</tt>,
            <tt class="literal">JAVA_OBJECT</tt>, <tt class="literal">STRUCT</tt>,
            and <tt class="literal">OTHER</tt>.
            When you run a query that returns any of these, SqlTool will
            save the very first such value obtained to the binary buffer
            and will not display any output from this query.
            You can then save the binary value to a file, as explained in the
          <a href="ch08.html#binary_files-section" title="
                Storing and retrieving binary files">
                Storing and retrieving binary files</a>
            section.
            </p><p>
            There are other types, such as <tt class="literal">BINARY</tt>, which
            JDBC can make displayable (by using ResultSet.getString()), but 
            which you may very well want to retrieve in raw binary format.
            You can use the \b command to retrieve any-column-type-at-all
            in raw binary format (so you can later store the value to a
            binary file).
            </p><p>
            Another restriction which all text-based database clients have
            is the practical inability for the user to type in binary data 
            such as photos, audio streams, and serialized Java objects.
            You can use SqlTool to load any binary object into a database
            by telling SqlTool to get the insert/update datum from a file.
            This is also explained in the
          <a href="ch08.html#binary_files-section" title="
                Storing and retrieving binary files">
                Storing and retrieving binary files</a>

                Desktop shortcuts and quick launch icons are useful, especially 
                if you often run SqlTool with the same set of arguments.
                It's really easy to set up several of them-- one for each 
                way that you invoke SqlTool (i.e., each one would start
                SqlTool with all the arguments for one of your typical startup
                needs).
                One typical setup is to have one shortcut for each database 
                account which you normally use (use a different
                <tt class="literal">--urlid</tt> switch in each shortcut's
                <span class="guilabel">Target</span> specification.
            </p><p>
                Desktop icon setup varies depending on your Desktop manager,
                of course.
                I'll explain how to set up a SqlTool startup icon in Windows
                XP.
                Linux and Mac users should be able to take it from there, since
                it's easier with the common Linux and Mac desktops.

            RC files can be used by any JDBC client program that uses the

            SqlTool, DatabaseManager, DatabaseManagerSwing.
            You can use it for your own JDBC client programs too.

            You can put this file anywhere you want to, and specify the 
            location to SqlTool/DatabaseManager/DatabaseManagerSwing by
            using the <tt class="literal">--rcfile</tt> argument.
            If there is no reason to not use the default location (and there 
            are situations where you would not want to), then use the default
            location and you won't have to give <tt class="literal">--rcfile</tt>
            arguments to SqlTool/DatabaseManager/DatabaseManagerSwing.
            The default location is <tt class="filename">sqltool.rc</tt> or
            <tt class="filename">dbmanager.rc</tt> in your home directory
            (corresponding to the program using it).
            If you have any doubt about where your home directory is, just 
            run SqlTool with a phony urlid and it will tell you where it 
            expects the configuration file to be.
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar x</pre></div></p><p>
            The config file consists of stanza(s) like this:

    url jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost
    username web
    password webspassword</pre></div></p><p>
            These four settings are required for every urlid.
            (There are optional settings also, which are described a couple 
            paragraphs down).
            You can have as many blank lines and comments like
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    # This comment</pre></div>
        </p><p>
            in the file as you like.
            The whole point is that the <span class="emphasis"><em>urlid</em></span> that you 
            give in your SqlTool/DatabaseManager command must match a 
            <span class="emphasis"><em>urlid </em></span> in your configuration file.

            When you are typing into SqlTool, you are always typing part of
            the <span class="emphasis"><em>current command</em></span>.
            The <span class="emphasis"><em>buffer</em></span> is the <span class="emphasis"><em>last SQL 
            command</em></span>.
            If you're typing an SQL command, then the previous SQL command
            will be in the buffer, not the one you are currently typing.
            The current command could be any type of command, but only SQL
           
            When you type command-editing commands, the <span class="emphasis"><em>current
            command</em></span> is the editing command (like
            "<tt class="literal">:s/tbl/table/</tt>"), the result of which is to
            modify the SQL command in the buffer (which can thereafter be
            executed).
            The ":a" command (with no argument) is special in that it takes a
            copy of the SQL command in the buffer and makes that the current 
            command, leaving you in a state where you are 
            <span class="emphasis"><em>appending</em></span> to that 
            <span class="emphasis"><em>now current</em></span> command.
            The buffer is the zeroeth item of the SQL command history.

                Above, we said that if you enter an SQL command, one
                SQL command corresponds to one SqlTool command.
                This is the most typical usage, however,
                you can actually put multiple SQL statements into one
                SQL command.
                One example would be
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0); SELECT * FROM t1;</pre></div>
                This is one SqlTool command containing two SQL statements.
                See the 
                <a href="ch08.html#chunk-section" title="Chunking">Chunking</a>
                section to see why you may want to <span class="emphasis"><em>chunk</em></span>
                SQL commands, how, and the implications.
            </p></div><dl><dt><span class="term">SQL Statement</span></dt><dd><p>
                Any command that you enter which does not begin with "\", ":", 
                or "* " is an SQL Statement.
                The command is not terminated when you hit ENTER, like most 
                OS shells.
                You terminate SQL Statements with either ";" at the end of a 
                line, or with a blank line.
                In the former case, the SQL Statement will be executed against 
                the SQL database and the command will go into the command 
                buffer and SQL command history for editing or viewing later on.
                In the former case, 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>execute against the SQL database</em></span> means
                to transmit the SQL text to the database engine for execution.
                In the latter case (you end an SQL Statement with a blank 
                line), the command will go to the buffer and SQL history, but 
                will not be executed (but you can execute it later from the 
                buffer).
                (See the note immediately above about multiple SQL statements 
                in one SqlTool command).
            </p><p>
                (Blank lines are only interpreted this way when SqlTool is
                run interactively.
                In SQL files, blank lines inside of SQL statements remain
                part of the SQL statement).
            </p><p>
                As a result of these termination rules, whenever you are 
                entering text that is not a Special Command, Buffer Command, 
                or PL Command, you are always 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>appending</em></span> lines to an SQL Statement.
                (In the case of the first line, you will be appending to an
                empty SQL statement.  I.e. you will be starting a new SQL 
                Statement).

                All of the PL Commands begin with "*".
                PL commands are for setting and using scripting variables
                and conditional and flow control statements like
                <tt class="literal">* if</tt> and <tt class="literal">* while</tt>.
                A few PL features (such as PL aliases and updating and
                selecing data directly from/to files) can be a real 
                convenience for nearly all users, so these features will be
                discussed briefly in this section.
                More detailed explanation of PL variables and the other 
                PL features, with examples, are covered in the

                In raw mode, SqlTool
                doesn't interpret what you type at all.  It all just
                goes into a buffer which you can send to the database
                engine.
                Beginners can safely ignore raw mode.
                You will never encounter it unless you run the "\."
                special command, or enter a PL/SQL command.

                If your database supports schemas, then the schema name will
                also be listed.
                </p><p>
                If you supply an optional <span class="emphasis"><em>filter substring</em></span>,
                then only items which contain the given substring (in the object

                    The substring test is case-sensitive!
                    Even though in SQL queries and for the "\d objectname"
                    command object names are usually case-insensitive, for 
                    the \dX commands, you must capitalize the filter 
                    substring exactly as it will appear in the special
                    command output.
                    This is an inconvenience, since the database engine
                    will change names in SQL to default case unless you 
                    double-quote the name, but that is server-side 
                    functionality which cannot (portably) be reproduced by 
                    SqlTool.
                    You can use spaces and other special characters in
                    the string.
                </p></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
                    Filter substrings ending with "." are special.
                    If a substring ends with ".", then this means to narrow
                    the search by the exact, case-sensitive schema name
                    given.
                    For example, if I run "\d* BLAINE.", this will list all
                    table-like database objects in the "BLAINE" schema.
                    The capitalization of the schema must be exactly the same 
                    as how the schema name is listed by the "\dn" command.
                    You can use spaces and other special characters in
                    the string.
                    (I.e., enter the name exactly how you would enter it 
                    inside of double-quotes in an SQL command).
                    This is an inconvenience, since the database engine
                    will change names in SQL to default case unless you 
                    double-quote the name, but that is server-side 
                    functionality which cannot (portably) be reproduced by 
                    SqlTool.

                    Indexes may not be searched for by 
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>substring</em></span>, only by
                    exact target table name.
                    So if <tt class="literal">I1</tt> is an index on table
                    <tt class="literal">T1</tt>, then you list this index by running
                    "\di T1".
                    In addition, many database vendors will report on indexes 
                    only if a target table is identified.
                    Therefore, "\di" with no argument will fail if your database

                If you supply a filter string, then only columns with a name

                The objectname is nearly always case-insensitive (depends on
                your database), but the filter is always case-sensitive.
                You'll find this filter is a great convenience compared to
                other database utilities, where you have to list all columns
                of large tables when you are only interested in one of them.

                When working with real data (as opposed to learning or playing),
                I often find it useful to run two SqlTool sessions in two
                side-by-side terminal emulator windows.
                I do all of my real work in one window, and use the other
                mostly for \d commands.
                This way I can refer to the data dictionary while writing SQL

                To list just the very last command, you would use the ":l"

            Be aware that the <tt class="literal">\!</tt> Special Command does
            not work for external programs that read from standard input.
            You can invoke non-interactive and graphical interactive programs, 
            but not command-line interactive programs.
        </p><p>
            SqlTool executes <tt class="literal">\!</tt> programs directly, it does 
            not run an operating system shell (this is to avoid OS-specific
            code in SqlTool).
            Because of this, you can give as many command-line arguments
            as you wish, but you can't use shell wildcards or redirection.

            The \w command can be used to store any command in your SQL 
            history to a file.
            Just restore the command to the buffer (which is the 0th
            element of the history) with a command like "\-4" before you give
            the \w command.

                Executes the SQL statement in the current buffer against the 
                database.
                This is an extremely useful command.
                It's easy to remember because it consists of
                ":", meaning <span class="emphasis"><em>Buffer Command</em></span>; plus a
                line-terminating ";", which sends the preceding SQL to the

                Enter append mode with the contents of the buffer as the 
                current SQL Statement.
                Things will be exactly as if you physically re-typed 
                the command that is in the buffer.
                Whatever line you type next will be appended to the SQL 
                Statement.
                You can execute the command by terminating a line with ";",
                or send it back to the buffer by entering a blank line.
                </p><p>
                You can, optionally, put a string after the :a, in which
                case this text will be appended and you will remain in
                append mode.
                (Unless the text ends with ';', in which case the resultant
                statement will be executed immediately).
                Note that if you do put text after the "a",
                <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> what you type immediately after
                "a" will be appended.
                If your buffer contains
                <tt class="literal">SELECT x FROM mytab</tt> and you run
                <tt class="literal">a:le</tt>, the resultant command will be
                <tt class="literal">SELECT x FROM mytable</tt>.
                If your buffer contains
                <tt class="literal">SELECT x FROM mytab</tt> and you run
                <tt class="literal">a: ORDER BY y</tt>, the resultant command will be
                <tt class="literal">SELECT x FROM mytab ORDER BY y</tt>.
                Notice that in the latter case the append text begins with a
                space character.

                This is the primary command for SqlTool command editing-- 
                it operates upon the current buffer.
                The "to string" and the "switches" are both optional.
                To start with, I'll discuss the use and behavior if you don't
                supply any substitution mode switches.
                </p><p>
                Don't use "/" if it occurs in either "from string" or "to 
                string".
                You can use any character that you want in place of "/", but 
                it must not occur in the <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> or 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> strings.
                Example
                <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    :s@from string@to string@</pre></div></p><p>
                The <span class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> string is substituted for the first 
                occurrence of the (case-specific)<span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span>
                string.
                The replacement will consider the entire SQL statement, even
                if it is a multi-line statement.
                </p><p>
                All occurrences of "$" in the <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> string
                and the <span class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> string are treated as line 
                breaks.
                For example, <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> string of
                "<tt class="literal">*$FROM mytable</tt>" would 
                actually look for occurrences of
                <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
     *
     FROM mytable</pre></div></p><p>
                Here is a another meaningful example using $.
                <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    :s/e)$/e) WHERE col1 is not null$/</pre></div></p><p>
                This command appends
                "<tt class="literal">WHERE col1 is not null</tt>" to the 
                line(s) which end with "e)".
                </p><p>
                The <span class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> string may be empty, in which case, 
                occurrences of the <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> string are just 
                deleted.  For example
                <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    :s/this//</pre></div></p><p>
                would remove the first occurrence of "this".
                (With the "g" substitution mode switch, as explained below,
                it would remove all occurrences of "this").
                </p><p>
                Don't end a <span class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> string with ";" in attempt to make a SQL
                statement execute.
                There is a substitution mode switch to use for that purpose.
                </p><p>
                You can use any combination of the substitution mode switches.
                <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                        Use "i" to make the searches for

                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Use "g" to substitute globally, i.e., for all 
                        occurrences of <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> string which 
                        are found in the text under consideration.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Use ";" to execute the command immediately after the
                        substitution is performed.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Use an integer (from 1 to 9) to narrow the text under

                        buffer.
                    </p></li></ul></div>
            </p><p>
                The substitution facility doesn't support any regular
                expressions at all.
                When we stop supporting Java versions older than 1.4, I'll
                start supporting regular expressions and other advanced
                string manipulation functions.

                Set the value of a variable.
                If the variable doesn't exist yet, it will be created.
                The most common use for this is so that you can later use
                it in SQL statements, print statements, and PL conditionals,
                by using the <tt class="literal">*{VARNAME}</tt> construct.
            </p><p>
                    If you set a variable to an SQL statement (without the
                    terminating ";") you can then use it as a PL alias like
                    <tt class="literal">*VARNAME</tt>, as shown in this example.

    /q WHERE mass &gt; 200;</pre></div>
            </p><p>
                If you put variable definitions into the SQL file
                <tt class="filename">auto.sql</tt> in your home directory, those
                aliases/variables will always be available for interactive use.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">* load VARNAME /file/path.txt</span></dt><dd>

                Indicate that next command should be a SQL INSERT or UPDATE
                command containing one question mark.
                The value of VARNAME will be substuted for the ? variable.
                This does work for CLOB columns.
            </dd><dt><span class="term">* VARNAME _</span></dt><dd>
                When next SQL command is run, instead of displaying the rows,
                just store the very first column value to variable VARNAME.
                This works for CLOB columns.
                It also works with Oracle XML type columns if you use
                column labels and the <tt class="literal">getclobval</tt> function.
            </dd><dt><span class="term">* dump VARNAME /file/path.txt</span></dt><dd>

            Note that PL commands are used to upload and download column
            values to/from local ASCII files, but the corresponding actions 
            for binary files use the special \b commands.
            This is because PL variables are used for ASCII values and
            you can store any number of column values in PL variables.
            This is not true for binary column values.
            The \b commands work with a single binary byte buffer.
        </p><p>
            See the <a href="ch08.html#pl-section" title="SqlTool Procedural Language">SqlTool Procedural Language</a> section 
            below for information on using variables in other ways, and 
            information on the other PL commands and features.

                Storing and retrieving binary files</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            You can upload binary files such as photographs, audio files,
            or serialized Java objects into database columns.
            SqlTool keeps one binary buffer which you can load from files
            with the \bl command, or from a database query by doing a
            one-row query for any non-displayable type (including
            <tt class="literal">BLOB</tt>, <tt class="literal">OBJECT</tt>, and
            <tt class="literal">OTHER</tt>).
            In the latter case, the data returned for the first
            non-displayable column of the first result row will be stored 
            into the binary buffer.
        </p><p>
            Once you have data in the binary buffer, you can upload it
            to a database column (including <tt class="literal">BLOB</tt>,
            <tt class="literal">OBJECT</tt>, and <tt class="literal">OTHER</tt> type
            columns), or save it to a file.
            The former is accomplished by the special command \bp followed
            by a <span class="emphasis"><em>prepared</em></span> SQL query containing one 
            question mark place-holder to indicate where the data gets
            inserted.
            The latter is accomplished with the \bd command.
        </p><p>
            You can also store the output from normal, displayable column
            into the binary buffer by using the special command \b.
            The very first column value from the first result row of the
            next SQL command will be stored to the binary byte buffer.

            You can also store and retrieve text column values to/from

            The SQL history shown by the \s command, and used by other commands,
            is truncated to 20 entries, since the utility comes from being 
            able to quickly view the history list.
            You can change the history length by setting the system property
            <tt class="literal">sqltool.historyLength</tt> to an integer like
            <pre class="screen">
java -Dsqltool.historyLength=40 -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar urlid</pre>
        </p><p>
            The SQL history list explicitly does not contain Special, Buffer,
            or PL commands.
            It only contains SQL commands, valid or invalid, successful or 
            unsuccessful.
            The reason for including bad SQL commands is so that you can 
            recall and edit them if you want to.
            The same applies to the editing buffer (which is element 0
            of the history).

            You normally use non-interactive mode for piping.  You specify
            "-" as the SQL file name.

            You can run SqlTool <span class="emphasis"><em>interactively</em></span>, but
            have SqlTool behave exactly as if it were processing an SQL
            file (i.e., no command-line prompts, error-handling
            that defaults to fail-upon-error, etc.).
            Just specify "-" as the SQL file name in the command line.
            This is a good way to test what SqlTool will do when it 
            encounters any specific command in an SQL file.
            See the <a href="ch08.html#scripting-section" title="Piping and shell scripting">Piping and shell scripting</a>

            Even if your plans are to run SqlTool non-interactively, you 
            should really learn to run it interactively because it's such a

            As you'll see, SqlTool has many features that are very

                SQL commands with a simicolon, of course.
            </p></div>
            </p><p>
                Since SqlTool transmits SQL statements to the database engine
                only when a line is terminated with ";", if you want feedback
                from multiple SQL statements in an --sql expression, you will
                need to use functionality of your OS shell to include
                linebreaks after the semicolons in the expression.
                With any Bourne-compatible shell, you can include linebreaks in 
                the SQL statements like this.
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar --sql 'SQL statement' urlid '
        SQL statement number one;
        SQL statement
            number two;
        SQL statement three;
    ' urlid</pre></div>
                If you don't need feedback, just separate the SQL commands
                with semicolons and the entire expression will be
                <a href="ch08.html#chunk-section" title="Chunking">chunked</a>.
            </p><p>
                The <span class="emphasis"><em>--sql</em></span> switch is very useful for 
                setting shell variables to the output of SQL Statements, like 
                this.
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
    # A shell script
    USERCOUNT=`java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar --sql '

        # Handle the SqlTool error
    }
    echo "There are $USERCOUNT users registered in the database."
    [ "$USECOUNT" -gt 3 ] &amp;&amp; {   # If there are more than 3 users registered
        # Some conditional shell scripting</pre></div>

                Just give paths to sql text file(s) on the command line after 
                the <span class="emphasis"><em>urlid</em></span>.
            </p><p>
                Often, you will want to redirect output to a file, like
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar sql... &gt; /tmp/log.sql 2&gt;&amp;1</pre></div></p><p>
                (Skip the "2&gt;&amp;1" if you're on Windows).
            </p><p>
                You can also execute SQL files from an interactive session with
                the "\i"' Special Command,
                but be aware that the default behavior in an interactive 
                session is to continue upon errors.
                If the SQL file was written without any concern for error
                handling, then the file will continue to execute after errors
                occur.
                You could run <tt class="literal">\c false</tt> before 
                <tt class="literal">\i filename</tt>, but then your SqlTool session
                will exit if an error is encountered in the SQL file.
                If you have an SQL file without error handling, and you want
                to abort that file when an error occurs, but not exit 
                SqlTool, the easiest way to accomplish this is usually to add
                <tt class="literal">\c false</tt> to the top of the script.
            </p><p>
                If you specify multiple SQL files on the command-line, the
                default behavior is to exit SqlTool if any of the SQL files
                encounters an error.
            </p><p>
                <span class="bold"><b>
                SQL files themselves have ultimate control over error handling.
                </b></span>
                Regardless of what command-line options are set, or what 
                commands you give interactively, if a SQL file gives error
                handling statements, they will take precedence.
            </p><p>
                You can also use \i in SQL files.
                This results in nested SQL files.
            </p><p>
                You can use the following SQL file,
                <tt class="filename">sample.sql</tt>, which resides in the
                <tt class="filename">src/org/hsqldb/sample</tt> directory of your
                HSQLDB distribution.
                It contains SQL as well as Special Commands making good

                You can type commands in to SqlTool while being in 
                non-interactive mode by supplying "-" as the file name.
                This is a good way to test how SqlTool will behave when

                If you want your SQL scripts optimally compatible among other
                SQL tools, then don't use any Special or PL Commands.
                SqlTool has default behavior which I think is far superior to 
                the other SQL tools, but you will have to disable these 
                defaults in order to have optimally compatible behavior.
            </p><p>
                These switches provide compatibilty at the cost of poor 
                control and error detection.
                <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                            --continueOnErr
                        </p><p>
                            The output will still contain error messages about
                            everything that SqlTool doesn't like
                            (malformatted commands, SQL command failures, 
                            empty SQL commands), but SqlTool will continue to
                            run.
                            Errors will not cause rollbacks (but that won't
                            matter because of the following setting).

                You don't have to worry about accidental expansion of 
                PL variables, since SqlTool will never expand PL variables
                if you don't set any variables on the command line, or give 
                any "* " PL commands.
                (And you could not have "* " commands in a compatible SQL

                not treat them as comments.
                If they occur within an SQL Statment, SqlTool will pass them to
                the database engine, and the DB engine will determine whether

                    \i to read it in interactively, or if another SQL file
                    uses \i to nest it.
                    If \q is encountered, SqlTool will quit.

                    the user and SqlTool will exit with a failure status.
                    If you give no abort message, then SqlTool will exit

                    Be aware that the current continue-upon-error behavior

                    If you redirect output to a file, this can make a long

                    This will HTML-ify the entire session.
                    For example,
                    <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar urlid filepath1.sql... &gt; /tmp/log.html 2&gt;&amp;1</pre></div>

                    This turns on and off SQL transaction autocommits.
                    Auto-commit defaults to false, but you can change that
                    behavior by using the <tt class="literal">--autoCommit</tt>
                    command-line switch.
                </dd><dt><span class="term">\c [true|false]</span></dt><dd><p>
                    A "true" setting tells SqlTool to Continue when errors are 
                    encountered.
                    The current transaction will not be rolled back upon SQL
                    errors, so if \c is true, then run the
                    <tt class="literal">ROLLCACK;</tt> command yourself if that's 
                    what you want to happen.
                    The default for interactive use is to continue upon error, 
                    but the default for non-interactive use is to abort upon 
                    error.
                    You can override this behavior by using the
                    <tt class="literal">--continueOnErr</tt> or the
                    <tt class="literal">--abortOnErr</tt> command-line switch.
                    </p><p>
                    With database setup scripts, I usually find it convenient 
                    to set "true" before dropping tables (so that things will 
                    continue if the tables aren't there), then set it back to 
                    false so that real errors are caught.
                    <tt class="literal">DROP TABLE tablename IF EXISTS;</tt>
                    is a more elegant, but less portable, way to accomplish
                    the same thing.
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
                        It depends on what you want your SQL files to do, of
                        course, but I usually want my SQL files to abort when
                        an error is encountered, without necessarily killing 
                        the SqlTool session.
                        If this is the behavior that you want, then
                        put an explicit <tt class="literal">\c false</tt>
                        at the top of your SQL file and turn on
                        continue-upon-error only for sections where you really
                        want to permit errors, or where you are using PL
                        commands to handle errors manually.
                        This will give the desired behavior whether your 
                        script is called by
                        somebody interactively, from the SqlTool command-line, 
                        or included in another SQL file (i.e. nested).
                    </p></div><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>
                        The default settings are usually best for people who 
                        don't want to put in any explicit \c or error handling 
                        code at all.
                        If you run SQL files from the SqlTool command line,
                        then any errors will cause SqlTool to roll back and
                        abort immediately.
                        If you run SqlTool interactively and invoke SQL files
                        with \i commands, the scripts will continue to run
                        upon errors (and will not roll back).
                        This behavior was chosen because there are lots of
                        SQL files out there that produce errors which can be
                        ignored; but we don't want to ignore errors that a
                        user won't see.
                        I reiterate that any and all of this behavior can (and 
                        often should) be changed by Special Commands run in 
                        your interactive shell or in the SQL files.
                        Only you know whether errors in your SQL files can
                        safely be ignored.

                SqlTool is ideal for mission-critical automation because,
                unlike other SQL tools, SqlTool returns a dependable exit 
                status and gives you control over error handling and SQL 
                transactions.
                Autocommit is off by default, so you can build a completely
                dependable solution by intelligently using \c commands 
                (Continue upon Errors) and commit statements, and by
                verifying exit statuses.
            </p><p>
                Using the SqlTool Procedural Language, you have ultimate
                control over program flow, and you can use variables for
                database input and output as well as for many other purposes.
                See the <a href="ch08.html#pl-section" title="SqlTool Procedural Language">SqlTool Procedural Language</a>
                section.

                Some script developers may run into cases where they want to 
                run with sql files but they alwo want SqlTool's interactive 
                behavior.
                For example, they may want to do command recall in the sql file,
                or they may want to log SqlTool's command-line prompts (which 
                are not printed in non-interactive mode).
                In this case, do not give the sql file(s) as an argument to 
                SqlTool, but pipe them in instead, like
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
java -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar urlid &lt; filepath1.sql &gt; /tmp/log.html 2&gt;&amp;1</pre></div>
                or
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

                Character Encoding</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                SqlTool defaults to the US-ASCII character set (for reading).
                You can use another character set by setting the system 
                property <span class="property">sqlfile.charset</span>, like
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
java -Dsqlfile.charset=UTF-8 -jar $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar urlid file.sql...</pre></div></p><p>
                You can also set this per urlid in the SqlTool configuration 
                file.
                See the <a href="ch08.html#auth-section" title="RC File Authentication Setup">RC File Authentication Setup</a>

            This section is about making a file containing the output of 
            database queries.
            You can generate reports by using operating system facilities
            such as redirection, tee, and cutting and pasting.
            But it is much easier to use the "\o" and "\H" special commands.
        </p><div class="procedure"><p class="title"><b>Procedure&nbsp;8.5.&nbsp;Writing query output to an external file</b></p><ol type="1"><li><p>
                By default, everthing will be done in plain text.
                If you want your report to be in HTML format, then give the
                special command <tt class="literal">\H</tt>.
                If you do so, you will probably want to use filenames with an
                suffix of ".html" or ".htm" instead of ".txt" in the next step.
            </p></li><li><p>
                Run the command <tt class="literal">\o path/to/reportfile.txt</tt>.
                From this point on, output from your queries will be appended
                to the specified file.
                (I.e. another <span class="emphasis"><em>copy</em></span> of the output is
                generated.)
                This way you can continue to monitor or use output as usual as
                the report is generated.
            </p></li><li><p>
                When you want SqlTool to stop writing to the file, run
                <tt class="literal">\o</tt> (or just quit SqlTool if you have no 
                other work to do).
            </p></li><li><p>
                If you turned on HTML mode with <tt class="literal">\H</tt> before,
                you can run <tt class="literal">\H</tt> again to turn it back off,
                if you wish.

            It is not just the output of "SELECT" statements that will make

                    (I.e., "\dt", "\dv", etc., and "\d OBJECTNAME").
                </li><li>
                    Output of "\p" Special Commands.
                    You will want to use this to add titles, and perhaps
                    spacing, for the output of individual queries.
                </li></ul></div>
            Other output will go to your screen or stdout, but will not make
            it into the report file.
            Be aware that no error messages will go into the report file.
            If SqlTool is run non-interactively (including if you give any
            SQL file(s) on the command line), SqlTool will abort with an error
            status if errors are encountered.
            The right way to handle errors is to check the SqlTool exit status.
            (The described error-handling behavior can be modified with
            SqlTool command-line switches and Special Commands).
        </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
            Remember that \o <span class="emphasis"><em>appends</em></span> to the named file.

            targe file ahead of time.

            So that I don't end up with a bunch of junk in my report file, I
            usually leave \o off while I perfect my SQL.  With \o off,
            I perfect the SQL query until it produces on my screen exactly
            what I want saved to file.
            At this point I turn on \o and run ":;" to repeat the last SQL
            command.
            If I have several complex queries to run, I turn \o off and
            repeat until I'm finished.
            (Every time you turn \o on, it will append to the file, just
            like we need).
            </p><p>
            Usually it doesn't come to mind that I need a wider screen until
            a query produces lines that are too long.
            In this case, stretch your window and repeat the last command with
            the ":;" Buffer Command.

            Most importantly, run <tt class="filename">SqlTool</tt> interactively 
            and give the "*?" command to see what PL commands are available to 
            you.
        </p><p>
            PL variables will only be expanded after you run a PL command (or 
            set variable(s) from the command-line).
            We only want to turn on variable expansion if the user wants
            variable expansion.
            People who don't use PL don't have to worry about strings getting
            accidentally expanded.
        </p><p>
            All other PL commands imply the "*" command, so you only need to 
            use the "*" statement if your script uses PL variables
            and it is possible that no variables may be set before-hand (and
            no PL commands have been run previously).
            In this case, without "*", your script would silently use a
            literal value like "*{x}" instead of trying to expand it.
            With a preceding "*" command, PL will notice that the variable
            <tt class="literal">x</tt> has not been set and will generate an error.
            (If x had been set here will be no issue because setting a
            variable automatically turns on PL variable expansion).
        </p><p>
            PL is also used to upload and download column values to/from
            local ASCII files, analogously to the special \b commands
            for binary files.
            This is explained above in the Interactive
            <a href="ch08.html#interactive_pl_commands-section" title="PL Commands">Essential PL Command</a>

                </li><li>
                    You can set variables using the

                </li><li>
                    You can also set variables using the

                    I give a very brief but useful example of this below.

                    Variables are always expanded in SQL, Special, and PL
                    commands if they are written like
                    <tt class="literal">*{VARNAME}</tt>
                    (assuming that a PL command has been run previously).
                    Your SQL scripts can give good feedback by echoing the
                    value of variables with the "\p" special command.
                </li><li><p>
                    A variable written like <tt class="literal">/VARNAME</tt> is
                    expanded if it <span class="emphasis"><em>begins</em></span> an SQL
                    Statement.
                    This usage is called <span class="emphasis"><em>PL Aliasing</em></span>.
                    See the

                    Variables are normally written like 
                    <tt class="literal">*VARNAME</tt> in logical expressions to
                    prevent them from being evaluated too early.
                    See below about logical expressions.

                    You can't do math with expression variables, but you
                    can get functionality like the traditional
                    <tt class="literal">for (i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)</tt> by appending
                    to a variable and testing the string length, like

    * while (*i &lt; ${x})
        * i = *{i}.</pre>

                </p></li><li><p>
                Variable names must not contain white space, or
                the characters "}" or "=".

                PL Aliasing just means the use of a PL variable as the first
                thing in an SQL statement, with the shortcut notation
                <tt class="literal">/VARNAME</tt>.
            </p><p>
                <tt class="literal">/VARNAME</tt> must be followed by whitespace
                or terminate the Statement, in order for SqlFile to tell
                where the variable name ends.
            </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
                Note that PL aliases are a very different thing from
                SQL aliases or HSQLDB aliases, which are features of
                databases, not SqlFile.
            </p></div><p>
                If the value of a variable is an entire SQL command, you
                generally do not want to include the terminating ";" in
                the value.
                There is an example of this 
                <a href="ch08.html#alias-example" title="Example&nbsp;8.2.&nbsp;Defining and using a PL alias (PL variable)">above</a>.
            </p><p>
            PL aliasing may only be used for SQL statements.
            You can define variables for everything in a Special or PL Command,
            except for the very first character ("\" or "*").
            Therefore, you can use variables other than alias variables in 
            Special and PL Commands.
            Here is a hyperbolically impractical example to show the extent to
            which PL variables can be used in Special commands even though you
            can not use them as PL aliases.
            <pre class="programlisting">
        sql&gt; * qq = p Hello Butch
        sql&gt; \*{qq} done now
        Hello Butch done now</pre>
            (Note that the \* here is not the special command "\*", but is
            the special command "\p" because "*{qq}" resolves to "p").
        </p></div><p>
                Here is a short SQL file that gives the specified user write
                permissions on some application tables.
            </p><div class="example"><a name="N11985"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.8.&nbsp;Simple SQL file using PL</b></p><pre class="programlisting">

                Note that this script will work for any (existing) user just
                by supplying a different user name on the command-line.
                I.e., no need to modify the tested and proven script.
                There is no need for a <tt class="literal">commit</tt> statement
                in this SQL file since no DML is done.
                If the script is accidentally run without setting the
                USER variable, SqlTool will give a very clear notificaton of
                that.
            </p><p>
                The purpose of the plain "*" command is just
                so that the *{USER} variables will be expanded.
                (This would not be necessary if the USER variable, or any
                other variable, were set, but we don't want to depend upon 
                that).

                (The parentheses after "foreach" do not enclose a logical
                expression, they just enclose a list).
            </p><p>
                There is a critical difference between 
                <tt class="literal">*{VARNAME}</tt> and <tt class="literal">*VARNAME</tt>
                inside logical expressions.
                <tt class="literal">*{VARNAME}</tt> is expanded one time when the
                parser first encounters the logical expression.
                <tt class="literal">*VARNAME</tt> is re-expanded every time that the
                expression is evaluated.
                So, you would never want to code
                <tt class="literal">* while (*{X} &lt; 5)</tt> because the statement
                will always be true or always be false.
                (I.e. the following block will loop infinitely or will never
                run).
            </p><p>
                Don't use quotes or whitespace of any kind in
                <tt class="literal">*{VARNAME}</tt> variables in expressions.
                (They would expand and then the expression would most likely
                no longer be a valid expression as listed in the table below).
                Quotes and whitespace are fine in <tt class="literal">*VARNAME</tt>
                variables, but it is the entire value that will be used in
                evaluations, regardless of whether quotes match up, etc.
                I.e. quotes and whitespace are not <span class="emphasis"><em>special</em></span>
                to the token evaluator.
            </p><div class="variablelist"><p class="title"><b>Logical Operators</b></p><dl><dt><span class="term">TOKEN</span></dt><dd>
                    The token may be a literal, a <tt class="literal">*{VARNAME}</tt>

                    late.

                *VARNAMEs in logical expressions, where the VARNAME variable
                is not set, evaluate to an empty string.
                Therefore <tt class="literal">(*UNSETVAR = 0)</tt> would be false,

                When developing scripts, you definitely use SqlTool 
                interactively to verify that SqlTool evaluates logical 
                expressions as you expect.
                Just run <tt class="literal">* if</tt> commands that print something
                (i.e. \p) if the test expression is true.

                Flow control works by conditionally executing blocks of 
                Commands according to conditions specified by logical 
                expressions.
            </p><p>
                The conditionally executed blocks are called 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>PL Blocks</em></span>.
                These PL Blocks always occur between a PL flow control 
                statement (like <tt class="literal">* foreach, *while, * if</tt>)
                and a corresponding <tt class="literal">* end</tt> PL Command
                (like <tt class="literal">* end foreach</tt>).
            </p><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Caution</h3><p>
                Be aware that the PL block reader is ignorant about SQL 
                statements and comments when looking for the end of the block.
                It just looks for lines beginning with some specific PL commands.
                Therefore, if you put a comment line before a PL statement, 
                or if a line of a multi-line SQL statement has a line beginning
                with a PL command, things may break.
                </p><p>
                I am not saying that you shouldn't use PL commands or SQL
                commands inside of PL blocks-- you definitely should!
                I'm saying that in PL blocks you should not have lines inside 
                of SQL statments or comments which could be mistaken for PL 
                commands.
                (Especially, "commenting out" PL end statements will not work
                if you leave <tt class="literal">* end</tt> at the beginning of the
                line).
                </p><p>
                (This limitation will very likely be removed in a future 
                version of SqlTool).
            </p></div><p>
                The values of control variables for foreach and while PL
                blocks will change as expected.
            </p><p>
                There are <tt class="literal">* break</tt> and 
                <tt class="literal">* continue</tt>, which work as any shell
                scripter would expect them to.
                The <tt class="literal">* break</tt> command can also be used to
                quit the current SQL file without triggering any error 
                processing.
                (I.e. processing will continue with the next line in the 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>including</em></span> SQL file or interactive 
                session, or with the next SQL file if you supplied multiple on

            We hereby call the ability to transmit multiple SQL commands to
            the database in one transmission <span class="emphasis"><em>chunking</em></span>.
            Unless you are in Raw mode, SqlTool only transmits commands to the
            database engine when it reads in a ";" at the end of a line of an
            SQL command.
            Therefore, you normally want to end each and every SQL command 
            with ";" at the end of a line.
            This is because the database can only send one status reply to
            each JDBC transmission.
            So, while you could run
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    SELECT * FROM t1; SELECT * FROM t2;</pre></div>
            SqlTool can only display the results from the last query.
            This is a limitation of the client/server nature of JDBC, and
            applies to any JDBC client.
            There are, however, situations where you don't need immediate
            feedback from every SQL command.  For example,
        <div class="example"><a name="N11A63"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.10.&nbsp;Single-line chunking example</b></p><pre class="screen">
    INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0); SELECT * FROM t1;</pre></div>
            It's useful because the output of the second SQL command will tell
            you whether the first SQL command succeeded.  So, you won't miss
            the status output from the first command.
        </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N11A6A"></a>Why?</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                The first general reason to chunk SQL commands is performance.
                For standalone databases, the most common performance 
                bottleneck is network latency.
                Chunking SQL commands can dramatically reduce network traffic.
            </p><p>
                The second general reason to chunk SQL commands is if your
                database requires you to send multiple commands in one
                transmission.
                This is often the case when you need to tell the database
                the SQL or PL/SQL commands that comprise a stored procedure,
                function, trigger, etc.
            </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N11A71"></a>How?</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                The most simple way is enter as many SQL commands as you 
                want, but just do not end a line with ";" until you want
                the chunk to transmit.
                <div class="example"><a name="N11A76"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.11.&nbsp;Multi-line chunking example</b></p><pre class="screen">
    INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1)
    ; INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2)
    ; SELECT * FROM t1;</pre></div>
                If you list your command history with \s, you will see that
                all 3 SQL commands in 3 lines are in one SqlTool command.
                You can recall this SqlTool command from history to
                re-execute all three SQL commands.
            </p><p>
                The other method is by using 
                <a href="ch08.html#raw-section" title="Raw Mode">Raw Mode</a>.
                Go to the
                <a href="ch08.html#raw-section" title="Raw Mode">Raw Mode</a> section
                to see how.
                You can enter any text at all, exactly how you want it to
                be sent to the database engine.
                Therefore, in addition to chunking SQL commands, you can
                give commands for non-SQL extensions to the database.
                For example, you could enter JavaScript code to be used
                in a stored procedure.
            </p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="raw-section"></a>Raw Mode</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            You begin raw mode by issuing the Special Command "\.".
            You can then enter as much text in any format you want.
            When you are finished, enter a line consisting of only ".".
            If you are running SqlTool interactively, you'll notice that
            your prompt will be the continuation prompt until you enter
            the "." line.
        </p><p>
            When you terminate raw entry with the "\." line, the command
            does not <span class="emphasis"><em>execute</em></span>, it just goes into the
            command buffer.
            If running interactively, you can look at the buffer with the
            ":l" Buffer Command.
            What you will normally want to do is to enter the Buffer Command
            ":;" to transmit the buffer to the database engine.
        </p><p>
            <div class="example"><a name="N11A95"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.12.&nbsp;Raw Mode example</b></p><pre class="screen">
    sql&gt; \.
    Enter RAW SQL.  No \, :, * commands.  End with a line containing only ".":
    raw&gt; line one;
      +&gt; line two;
      +&gt; line three;
      +&gt; .
    Raw SQL chunk moved into buffer.  Run ":;" to execute the chunk.
    sql&gt; :;
    Executing command from buffer:
    line one;
    line two;
    line three;

    SQL Error at 'stdin' line 13:
    "line one;
    line two;
    line three;"
    Unexpected token: LINE in statement [line]
    sql&gt;</pre></div>
            The error message "Unexpected token: LINE in statement [line]"
            comes from the database engine, not SqlTool.
            All three lines were transmitted to the database engine.
        </p><p>
            Buffer Commands are generally unavailable when runninb SqlTool
            interactively.
            However, the command ":;", and the command buffer have been
            enabled for non-interactive use, because they are required for
            using raw mode, and it is definitely useful to be able to
            use raw mode in SQL files.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N11A9E"></a>PL/SQL</h2></div></div><div></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
            PL/SQL is <span class="bold"><b>not</b></span> the same as
            PL.  PL is the procedural language of SqlFile and is 
            independent of your back-end database.
            PL commands always begin with *.
            PL/SQL is processed on the server side and you can only use
            it of your database supports it.
            You can not intermix PL and PL/SQL (except for setting a
            PL variable to the output of PL/SQL execution), because when
            you enter PL/SQL to SqlTool that input is not processed
            by SqlFile.
        </p></div><p>
            Use <a href="ch08.html#raw-section" title="Raw Mode">Raw Mode</a> to send
            PL/SQL code blocks to the database engine.
            You do not need to enter the "\." command to enter raw mode.
            Just begin a new SqlTool command line with "DECLARE" or 
            "BEGIN", and SqlTool will automatically put you into raw mode.

            If you do not need to directly use JDBC URLs like
            <tt class="literal">jdbc:hsqldb:mem:</tt> + something,
            <tt class="literal">jdbc:hsqldb:file:</tt> + something, or
            <tt class="literal">jdbc:hsqldb:res:</tt> + something,
            then you can use <tt class="filename">hsqltool.jar</tt> in place of
            the much larger <tt class="filename">hsqldb.jar</tt> file.
            <tt class="filename">hsqltool.jar</tt> will work for all JDBC
            databases other than HSQLDB Memory-only and In-process databases
            (the latter are fine if you access them via a HSQLB Server or
            WebServer).
            You will have to supply the JDBC driver for non-HSQLDB URLs, of
            course.
        </p><p>
            <tt class="filename">hsqltool.jar</tt> includes the HSQLDB JDBC

            If you do not need to connect to HSQLDB databases at all,

            databases.

            The HSQLDB distribution doesn't "come with" a pre-built

            These features were added for version 1.8.0.3 of HSQLDB.
        </p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
            This feature is independent of HSQLDB 
            <a href="ch06.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Text Tables">Text Tables</a>,
            a server-side feature of HSQLDB.
            It makes no difference to SqlTool whether the source or target
            table of your export/import is a memory, cache, or text table.
            Indeed, like all features of SqlTool, it works fine with other
            JDBC databases.
            It works great, for example to migrate data from a table
            of one type to a table of another type, or to another schema,
            or to another database instance, or to another database system.
        </p></div><p>
            Because of common usage of the term, I call this feature
            <span class="emphasis"><em>CSV</em></span> imports and exports, even though the
            delimiters are not constrained to single characters, but
            may be any String.
            Use the <tt class="literal">\x</tt> command to eXport a table to a
            CSV file, and the <tt class="literal">\m</tt> command to iMport a
            CSV file into a pre-existing table.
        </p><p>
            Just as the delimiter capability is more general than traditional
            CSV delimiters, the export function is also more general than
            just a table data exporter.
            Besides the trivial generalization that you may specify a
            view or other virtual table name in place of a table name,
            you can alternatively export the output of any query which 
            produces normal text output.
            A benefit to this approach is that it allows you to export only
            some columns of a table, and to specify a WHERE clause to narrow 
            down the rows to be exported (or perform any other SQL 
            transformation, mapping, join, etc.).
            One specific use for this would be to exclude columns of
            binary data (which can be exported by other means, such as
            a PL loop to store binary values to files with the \bd command).
        </p><p>
            Note that the import command will not create a new table.
            This is because of the impossibility of guessing appropriate
            types and constraints based only on column names and a data
            sampling (which is all that a CSV-importer has access to).
            Therefore, if you wish to populate a new table, create the
            table before running the import.
            The import file does not need to have data for all columns of a
            table.
            The only required columns are those required by non-null and
            FK constraints.
            One specific reason to omit columns is if you want values of
            some columns to be created automatically by column DEFAULT
            settings, triggers, HSQLDB identity sequences, etc.
            Another reason would be to skip binary columns.
        </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N11B36"></a>Simple CSV exports and imports using default settings</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Even if you need to change delimiters, table names, or file
                names from the defaults, I suggest that you run one export
                and import with default settings as a practice run.
                A memory-only HSQLDB instance is ideal for test runs like this.
            </p><p>
                This command exports the table <tt class="literal">icf.projects</tt>
                to the file <tt class="filename">projects.csv</tt> in the current
                directory (where you invoked SqlTool from).
                By default, the output file name will be the specified source
                table name plus the extension <tt class="literal">.csv</tt>.
                <div class="example"><a name="N11B49"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.14.&nbsp;CSV Export Example</b></p><pre class="screen">    SET SCHEMA icf;
    \x projects
</pre></div>
                We could also have run <tt class="literal">\x icf.projects</tt>
                (which would have created a file named 
                <tt class="filename">icf.projects.csv</tt>)
                instead of changing the session schema.
                In this example we have chosen to make the export file name
                independent of the schema to facilitate importing it into
                a different schema.
            </p><p>
                Take a look at the output file.
                Notice that the first line consists of column names, not
                data.
                This line is present because it will be needed if the file is
                to used for a CSV import.
                Notice the following characterstics about the export data.
                The column delimiter is the pipe character "|".
                The record delimiter is the default line delimiter character(s)
                for your operating system.
                The string used to represent database <tt class="literal">NULL</tt>s
                is <tt class="literal">[null]</tt>.
                See the next section for how to change these from their default
                values.
            </p><p>
                This command imports the data from the file
                <tt class="filename">projects.csv</tt> in the current
                directory (where you invoked SqlTool from) into the table
                <tt class="literal">newschema.projects</tt>.
                By default, the output table name will be the input filename
                after removing optional leading directory and trailing final
                extension.
                <div class="example"><a name="N11B6C"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.15.&nbsp;CSV Import Example</b></p><pre class="screen">    SET SCHEMA newschema;
    \m projects.csv
</pre></div>
                If the CSV file was named with the target schema, you would
                have skipped the <tt class="literal">SET SCHEMA</tt> command, like
                <tt class="literal">\m newschema.projects.csv</tt>.
            </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N11B7B"></a>Specifying queries, delimiters, file names, table names,
                columns</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                The header line in the CSV file is required at this time.
                (If there is user demand, it can be made optional for
                exporting, but it will remain required for importing).
            </p><p>
                Your export will fail if the column or record delimiter, or
                the null representation value occurs in the data being
                exported.
                You change these values by setting the PL variables
                <tt class="literal">*CSV_COL_DELIM</tt>,
                <tt class="literal">*CSV_ROW_DELIM</tt>,
                <tt class="literal">*CSV_NULL_REP</tt>.
                Notice that the asterisk is part of the variable names, to
                indicate that these variables are used by SqlTool internally.
                You can use the escape sequences \n, \r, and \t in the
                usual manner.
                For example, to change the column delimiter to the tab character,
                you would give the command
                <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    * *CSV_COL_DELIM = \t</pre></div>
            </p><p>
                For imports, you must always specify the source CSV file path.
                If you want to <span class="emphasis"><em>export</em></span> to a different file 
                than one in the current directory named according to the source
                table, set the PL variable <tt class="literal">*CSV_FILEPATH</tt>,
                like
                <div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
    * *CSV_FILEPATH = /tmp/dtbl.csv</pre></div>
            </p><p>
                For exports, you must always specify the source table name
                or query.
                If you want to <span class="emphasis"><em>import</em></span> to a table other 
                than that derived from
                the input CSV file name, set the PL variable
                <tt class="literal">*CSV_TABLENAME</tt>.
                The table name may contain a schema name prefix.
            </p><p>
                At this time, you must import all columns that have data in
                the CSV file.
                If there is demand to specify an optional list of columns to
                import, I'll gladly add that feature.
            </p><p>
                You can specify a query instead of a tablename with the
                \x command in order to filter or transform data from a table
                or view, or to export the output of a join, etc.
                You must set the PL variable <tt class="literal">*CSV_FILEPATH</tt>,
                as explained above (since there is no table name from which to
                automatically map a file name).
                <div class="example"><a name="N11BB2"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;8.16.&nbsp;CSV Export of an Arbitrary SELECT Statement</b></p><pre class="screen">    * *CSV_FILEPATH = outfile.txt
    \x SELECT entrydate, 2 * aval "Double aval", modtime from bs.dtbl</pre></div>
                Note that I specified the column label alias "Double aval"
                so that the label for that column in the CSV file header will 
                not be blank.
